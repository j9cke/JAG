School project in the course Server Sided Web Development. The course took place at Jönköping University during the spring of 2016. 

A web platform in ASP.NET which communicates with an already existing database of a library system. 
The platform make it possible for users to register and to browse, search and borrow available books. The project was created with a so called 3-tier-architecture.
